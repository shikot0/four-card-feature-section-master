## Overview
I did this project I while back however I didn't feel like submitting it yet so after some revisions I have decided that this will be my first submission on frontend mentor with more to follow in the near future.
Also I have seen how bad my markup is in hindsight however I chose not to change too much of it in order to keep its authenticity in a sense.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned how to use grid-column/row-start/end as I used it quite a lot for this project but it seemed to work out quite well for me.

### Continued development
Going further I want to write more "efficient" markup as looking back on this now I realised that there were lots of different areas where I could have used other techniques such as using css variables for the box-shadow and top-borders of the cards, however I shall leave it as it is for now.
